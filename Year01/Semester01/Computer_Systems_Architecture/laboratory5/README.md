```
S: 1, 5, 3, 8, 2, 9
D1: 1, 3, 2
D2: 5, 8, 9
```

2.Two character strings S1 and S2 are given. Obtain the string D by concatenating the elements found on the positions multiple of 3 from S1 and the elements of S2 in reverse order.
```
S1: '+', '4', '2', 'a', '8', '4', 'X', '5'
S2: 'a', '4', '5'
D: '+', 'a', 'X', '5', '4', 'a'
