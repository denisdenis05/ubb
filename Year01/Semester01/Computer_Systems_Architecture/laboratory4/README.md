1.Given 4 bytes, compute in AX the sum of the integers represented by the bits 4-6 of the 4 bytes.

2.Given the quadword A, obtain the integer number N represented on the bits 17-19 of A. Then obtain the the doubleword B by rotating the high doubleword of A N positions to the left. Obtain the byte C as follows:
the bits 0-2 of C are the same as the bits 9-11 of B
the bits 3-7 of C are the same as the bits 20-24 of B
