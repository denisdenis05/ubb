1.Read two numbers a and b (base 10) from the keyboard and calculate: (a+b)*(a-b). The result of multiplication will be stored in a variable called "result" (defined in the data segment).

2.Read numbers (in base 10) in a loop until the digit '0' is read from the keyboard. Determine and display the biggest number from those that have been read.
